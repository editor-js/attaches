            "url" : "https://www.tesla.com/tesla_theme/assets/img/_vehicle_redesign/roadster_and_semi/roadster/hero.jpg",
            "size": 91,
            "name": "hero.jpg",
            "extension": "jpg"
        },
        "title": "Hero"
    }
}
```

## Backend response format

Response of your uploader **should** cover following format:

```json5
{
    "success" : 1,
    "file": {
        // any data you want
        // for example: url, name, size, title
    }
}
```

**success** - uploading status. 1 for successful, 0 for failed

**file** - uploaded file data. Can contain any data you want to store. All fields will be stored as [file object](#file-object) in output data.

Fields supported by the UI of block:

 - `title`
 - `size`
 - `extension` (if not present, will be extracted from the `name`)
 - `url`

## Providing custom uploading methods

As mentioned at the Config Params section, you have an ability to provide your own custom uploading method.
It is quite simple: implement `uploadByFile` method and pass them via `uploader` config param.
The method return a Promise that resolves with response in a format that described at the [backend response format](#backend-response-format) section.


| Method         | Arguments | Return value | Description |
| -------------- | --------- | -------------| ------------|
| uploadByFile   | `File`    | `{Promise.<{success, file: {url}}>}` | Upload file to the server and return an uploaded file data |

Example:

```js
import AttachesTool from '@editorjs/attaches';

var editor = EditorJS({
  ...

  tools: {
    ...
    attaches: {
      class: AttachesTool,
      config: {
        /**
         * Custom uploader
         */
        uploader: {
          /**
           * Upload file to the server and return an uploaded image data
           * @param {File} file - file selected from the device or pasted by drag-n-drop
           * @return {Promise.<{success, file: {url}}>}
           */
          uploadByFile(file){
            // your own uploading logic here
            return MyAjax.upload(file).then((response) => {
              return {
                success: 1,
                file: {
                  url: response.fileurl,
                  // any data you want
                  // for example: name, size, title
                }
              };
            });
          },
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ...
});
```
